# TweetDeleter.JS 

## What is this?

This is a simple script that will delete all of your tweets. It uses Puppeteer to fetch your tweets and then delete them one by one.

## How to use?

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Edit `.env` and change the `username` and `password` variables to your Twitter username and password
4. Run `npm start`
5. Wait for the script to finish

## Why?

I wanted to delete all of my tweets and I couldn't find a simple script that would do that for me. So I made one myself.
